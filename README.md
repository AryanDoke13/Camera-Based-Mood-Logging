# Camera-Based-Mood-Logging
üì∏ Camera-Based Mood Logging  A smart application that detects and logs your mood in real-time using your device‚Äôs camera. By analyzing facial expressions, it helps track emotional trends over time, enabling self-awareness and mental well-being insights.

Features

Real-Time Mood Detection: Uses the camera to detect facial expressions and infer mood.

Mood Logging: Automatically stores mood data with timestamps.

Mood Trends: Visualizes mood patterns over time to identify emotional trends.

Privacy-Focused: All data is stored locally; no cloud uploads required.

Simple Interface: Easy-to-use interface suitable for daily tracking.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript or Mobile UI framework (Flutter/React Native/Android)

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js for data logging (if required)

Machine Learning:

OpenCV ‚Äì for real-time face detection

MediaPipe ‚Äì for facial landmarks

Pretrained models (e.g., FER, DeepFace) ‚Äì for emotion classification

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Chart.js, or similar libraries

Storage: Local database (SQLite/JSON) for mood logs

‚ö° How It Works

The app accesses your device camera.

Captures frames of your face in real-time.

Detects facial landmarks and expressions using ML models.

Classifies your mood into categories (e.g., Happy, Sad, Neutral, Angry, Surprised).

Logs the mood with a timestamp for trend analysis.
